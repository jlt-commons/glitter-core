                Asserting only on the mutation log cannot distinguish 'moved
                the node' from 'duplicated the node' — both emit the same
                single :insert-before entry. test-renderer's insert-before did
                the latter (leaving [c a b c] where [c a b] was correct) and
                this deftest stayed green throughout, because it checked only
                the log. Caught by the final whole-branch review; this
                assertion is what pins it. Matters beyond glitter's own suite:
                test-renderer ships in src/, not test/, precisely so apps
                built on glitter can reuse it, and a corrupt snapshot tree
                makes get-child return the wrong node on any later reconcile."
